# CODEX CONTEXT — Movie Ticket Booking Backend

> Compact session handoff only. Canonical runtime state is
> `AI-contracts/state/current-work.yml`; effective contracts live under
> `AI-contracts/`. Do not copy technical contracts into this file.

## Startup

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the canonical state below.
3. Inspect the real branch, status, recent log and relevant diff.
4. Read the authorized current ticket and only its referenced contracts.
5. Report drift, unverified claims and exactly one next action before delivery work.
